# <b>OUC-IDEC</b>
Team UOregon is based out of the Plesa lab at the Univeristy of Oregon's Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. Our group focuses on developing high-throughput technologies to characterize sequence space, and we are interested in leveraging directed evolution as a strategy to explore natural adaptation and engineer proteins.
